## Im Innis

19 year old german pissdev with minimal knowledge and half-baked 50/50 code that runs like a 2 legged horse.
Student and working as trainee for systems integration (Im not even a software dude). 
If I ever publish something that people use, just dont ask me what and how and why. I don't know myself and my everything I write is build like a jenga tower after a stressfull 3 hour session with your family on christmas.
